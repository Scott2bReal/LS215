// Let's build another program using madlibs. We made a similar program in the
// Easy exercises, but this time the requirements are a bit different.

// Build a madlibs program that takes a text template as input, plugs in a
// selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into that
// text, and then returns it. You can build your lists of nouns, verbs,
// adjectives, and adverbs directly into your program. Your program should read
// this text and, for each line, place random words of the appropriate types
// into the text and return the result.

// The challenge of this program isn't just about writing your solutionâ€”it's
// about choosing the structure of the text template. Choose the right way to
// structure your template and this problem becomes much easier. Consequently,
// this exercise is a bit more open-ended since the input is also something
// that you'll be defining.

// These examples use the following list of replacement texts:
// adjectives: quick lazy sleepy noisy hungry
// nouns: fox dog head leg tail cat
// verbs: jumps lifts bites licks pats
// adverbs: easily lazily noisily excitedly
